Introduction
============

I found the `default MediaWiki print stylesheet <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Facebook&printable=yes>`_ to be quite 1995. This is an attempt to improve it with good layout and typographic sensibilities. 

Given the number of possible elements and layouts an average wiki page can assume, it will remain a work in progress for a while.
